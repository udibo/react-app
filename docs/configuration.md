## Tasks

To learn more about using the default tasks, see the
[tasks](getting-started.md#tasks) section in the getting started guide.

If you need to customize your build options to be different from the default,
follow the instructions for adding the [build.ts](getting-started.md#buildts)
and [dev.ts](getting-started.md#devts) files in the getting started guide.

You can add any tasks that you want to your configuration, for more information
on how to do so, see Deno's
[task runner](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/task_runner/) guide.

If you remove or rename any of the default tasks and you make use of our GitHub
workflows, you may need to modify them to use different tasks. See the
[CI/CD](ci-cd.md) guide for more information.
