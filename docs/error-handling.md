## UI

For UI routes, error handling typically involves using the included error
handling components and hooks. This allows you to catch and display errors in a
user-friendly manner, preventing the entire application from crashing due to a
single component error.

## API

In API routes, error handling involves catching and properly formatting errors,
setting appropriate HTTP status codes, and potentially logging errors for
debugging purposes. The framework provides utilities to streamline this process
and ensure consistent error responses across your API.
